			<p class="interesting_fact">Giant panda' main source of food is bamboo leaves and shoots, which are void of much nutritional value. This fact is due to pandas's carnivore-adapted digestive system and therefore they cannot digest cellulose well. Pandas must eat at least 30 pounds of bamboo daily to stay full. </p>
